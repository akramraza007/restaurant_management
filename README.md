# Akram's Restaurant Ordering System 🧾🍕

This is a simple Python-based console application that simulates a food ordering system for Akram's Restaurant. Users can view the menu, place multiple orders, and receive a final bill summary. The program uses a loop to allow continuous ordering until the user types `exit`.
